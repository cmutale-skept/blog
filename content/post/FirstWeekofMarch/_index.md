## How My Week Went 

This is a summary of how my first week of march went because i definitely can't post it all :) .

My first week of March really wasn't too bad. I took a trip to the VTB Arena and that was thee highlight of the week. I attended a sports event (just watched soccer with my friends).I did a lot of school work and studying of course and I also took some walks for fresh air. I also read an article on analytic continuation and finally understood how the non-trivial zeros of the Zeta function are important to prove the prime number theorem.

I could say it was one of my most productive weeks because I was able to get all my work done on time and still had time for life outside school. I created this website during my first week of march as a school assignment but I don't think of it as school work so it can be more fun. I also wrote a new training algorithm for my LLM. I had a very taxi ride to the airport where I was escorting my friend, on my way back I got bored and made a beautiful proof on why e(euler's number) is trancsendental, I also made some more proofs which I will post on my twitter. I did a lot of journaling and I might go back to posting vlogs and videos on youtube because I have gotten used to my schedule (The link to my youtube is on my twitter too) . You can send reccomendations of what you want to see more on my channel. How was your first week of march?

Thanks for reading!
