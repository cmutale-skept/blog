## My Last Week Of March

Hey reader! This month just flew by so fast. I've been so caught up doing schoolwork and practicing my hobbies.

In the last week of March, I started reading 'Dune' by Frank Herbert and it's really good. Of course I also did some gaming (I can kick your a** in CS2 so bad). 
I visited the atom exibit at Vdnkh and learnt about nuclear reactors and so much more, I wish I could have taken you along with me. Besides that I had a math-analysis test which turned out to not be as bad as I expected. Oh I almost forget I finally finished reading the 'hitchhickers guide to the galaxy' lmfao

That actually sums up my week. This would be way better as a video so look out for my vlogs on youtube lol. 

Have a good one!
